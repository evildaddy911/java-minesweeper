Simple Minesweeper Game by Evildaddy911

click on the gray boxes to check for a mine. If you click on a mine, your game is over
When you click on a box that is not a mine, the number shown is the number of nearby mines (within 1 square, including diagonal)
If the number is zero, the game will automatically click the surrounding squares untill it finds a square near a mine.

If you can uncover all the squares without finding a mine, you win!
